## Introduction

The prediction of house prices is a common task in the real estate industry and can provide valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and investors. In this project, we aim to build a machine-learning model that can accurately predict house prices based on historical data.

## Dataset

We use a publicly available dataset called the "House Price Dataset," which contains information about various houses. The dataset includes features such as the location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and corresponding sale prices. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate our models.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the trained models for house price prediction, you can run the provided scripts or integrate them into your own applications. Detailed instructions for using the models and making predictions will be available in the codebase.

## Model Training

The codebase includes scripts for training machine learning models using KNN.

## Evaluation

We evaluate the performance of the trained models using accuracy score and grid score.

## Contributing
